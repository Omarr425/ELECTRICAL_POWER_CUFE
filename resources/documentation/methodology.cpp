 * ### DISCRETIZED CALCULUS 
 *  - THIS PROJECT CURRENTLY uses a hyprid of eulers backward method and eulers forward method called 
 *    Central difference that provides a superior accuracy 
 *    local truncation error of Central difference O(h^3) second order method = better approximation
 *    local truncation error of Forward euler / Backward euler O(h^2) first order method = less supperior
 * 
 * - Currently only support trapezoidal approximation for integrals  
 *
 * ### PEAKS DETECTION
 * 
 * - PEAKS and TROUGHS are mainly approximated using first derivatives Like

 * 
 *  ### PERIODIC TIME CALCULATION METHODS USED
 *  
 *    ## PEAK AND TROUGH
 *    
 *      USING the extremas detected in previous steps in the analysis we can approximate frequency like this
 *      1. Store Times of Peaks detected
 *      2. Store Times of Troughs detected
 *      3. store times between consecutive peaks or consecutive troughs as the periodic time
 *  
 *      However this method is prone to double triggering at noisy peaks
 *      as illustrated bellow

 * 
 *    ## USING A SET TRIGGER LEVEL
 * 
 *      Using the A a set Value we call the "TRIGGER LEVEL" in which when the signal crosses it in a direction
 *      like the following its time gets stored
 *      1. signal values were below TRIGGER_LEVEL value and then it gets higher than TRIGGER_LEVEL we detect that instance
 *          of change and store it in a time vector for this event (RISING EDGE) 
 *      2. signal value maybe have been higher than the TRIGGER_LEVEL value and then it got lower than the TRIGGER_LEVEL 
 *          we detect that instance in a time vector for this even (FALLING EDGE)
 *      3. Define periodic times as the time difference between each consecutive RISING EDGES or consecutive FALLING EDGES 
 *

 * 
 * 
 *      - however this method is prone to noise double triggering at trigger level like the folllowing

 *      
 *    ## USING TRIGGERING WITH HYSTERESIS
 * 
 *      BY Implementing hysteresis when detecting edges double triggering due to noise could be eliminated
 *      the flow goes as following
 *      1. signal has initial state of low maybe
 *      2. signal cross the upper threshold and hysteresis block becomes high state(true state) (store that time) lets call it rising edge for now
 *      3. signal remains in high state until it crosses lower threshold and becomes low state
 *      4. once the signal alters to high again (store that time) another rising edge
 *      5. the time between each consecutive rising edges we call as periodic tim
