### For the sake of modularity and ease of synchronised work we are going to utilize project management Tools for example GIT 

### CLEAN CODING PRACTICES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED 
----1) Carefull , meaningful and elaborative naming for variables,functions and structures is a PRIORITY
----2) Alway care for the standards of Typing (case_sensitivity, Spacing ) 
----3) Use double spaces instead of regular tabs (can be changed from vscode)(File->Preferences->settings->"seach space") then change tabsize to 2 and tick insert spaces
----4) Leave small and meaningful comments that illustrates how this piece of code works
----5) Adopted clean architecture for the workspace (src->(core, features , ...))
----6) Never Forget to free any memory that once was allocated and isn't in use currently
*********IF possible please use DOXYGEN FOR in-process , easy code documenting  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen
